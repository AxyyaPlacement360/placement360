Graduate placement programs, also known as graduate schemes or entry-level programs, are structured initiatives offered by companies to recruit and develop fresh graduates into professional roles within their organization. These programs are designed to provide recent graduates with practical work experience, training, and mentorship opportunities to kick-start their careers.

Here are some key points to understand about graduate placement programs:

1. Purpose: Graduate placement programs aim to attract and nurture talented individuals who have recently completed their education. These programs provide a structured pathway for graduates to transition into the professional world and gain valuable hands-on experience in their chosen field.

2. Duration: Graduate programs typically run for a fixed period, often ranging from one to two years. During this time, participants rotate through different departments or teams within the organization, gaining exposure to various aspects of the business.

3. Training and Development: These programs offer comprehensive training and development opportunities to equip graduates with the skills and knowledge required for their roles. Training may include both technical and soft skills development, ranging from on-the-job training to workshops, seminars, and mentoring sessions.
